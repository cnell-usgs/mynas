  "body": "### Analyses of bird populations on the island of Tutuila, American Samoa. \r\nIn 2013 point-transect surveys were conducted along urban-natural gradients, in observation of the local bird community. \r\nAbundance counts were recorded with special emphasis to the presence of Common Mynas, _Acridotheres tristis_, a hyper-abundant exotic bird species that has plagued American Samoa as well as many other South Pacific islands. Analyses here are directed at estimating the island-wide population of Common Mynas, and environmental predictors of Myna density. \r\n",
